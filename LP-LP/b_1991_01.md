[b_1991_01](/BASBLib/LP-LP/b_1991_01) : [Linear-Linear](/BASBLib/LP-LP-problems) problem from [\[Bard, 1991\]][Bard, 1991]:

## Comments on the problem

First, let us note that our formulation is based on the original source [(Bard, 1991)][Bard, 1991], i.e., the first constraint is `x + y1 - 1 <= 0`, whereas the in subsequent sources it was changed into `x - y1 - 1 <= 0`. However, this does not have an impact on the optimal solution.

Moreover, in [(Bard, 1998)][Bard, 1998] & [(Shimizu et al., 1997)][Shimizu et al., 1997] wrong minimum value of outer-objective `F* = 1.0` is reported, which actually is `F* = -1.0`.

The leader is faced with an ambiguous situation for all choices but one. Only at `x = 1` is the follower's response, `y = (0.000, 0.000)`, unique. For `0 <= x < 1`, `F* = -1.0` is realized only when the follower cooperates and picks the largest possible value for y2, such that `x + y2 = 1`. Finally, note, that `x = 0, y = (0.000, 1.000)` is the best outcome from the follower's perspective `f* = -1.0`, while keeping the same mimum value `F* = -1.0` for the leader.

## Optimal solution

Objective values   | Solution points         |
------------------ | ----------------------- |
F* = -1.000        | __x__* = 1.000          |
f* = 0.000         | __y__* = (0.000, 0.000) |

## Description of the problem in the `AMPL` format

```ruby
var x >= 0, <= 10;         # Outer variable
var y{1..2} >= 0, <= 10;   # Inner variable
var l{1..7} >= 0, <= 10;   # KKT Multipliers

minimize outer_obj: -x + 10*y[1] - y[2];  # Outer objective

subject to
# Inner objective:
    inner_obj: -y[1] - y[2] = 0;
# Inner constraints
    inner_con1:     x + y[1] - 1 <= 0;
    inner_con2:     x + y[2] - 1 <= 0;
    inner_con3:     y[1] + y[2] - 1 <= 0;
# KKT conditions:
    stationarity_1:    -1 + l[1] + l[3] - l[4] + l[5] = 0;
    stationarity_2:    -1 + l[2] + l[3] - l[6] + l[7] = 0;
    complementarity_1: l[1]*(x + y[1] - 1) = 0;
    complementarity_2: l[2]*(x + y[2] - 1) = 0;
    complementarity_3: l[3]*(y[1] + y[2] - 1) = 0;
    complementarity_4: l[4]*y[1] = 0;
    complementarity_5: l[5]*(y[1] - 10) = 0;
    complementarity_6: l[6]*y[2] = 0;
    complementarity_7: l[7]*(y[2] - 10) = 0;
