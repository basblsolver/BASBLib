## Sources where this problem occur

In all sources mentioned below, the reported optimal solution occurs at (_x_*, _y_*) = (4.0, 4.0) with F* = -12.0 and f* = 4.0. However, it is easy to check that this point is not bilevel feasible. When the leader (outer decision maker) selects _x_ = 4.0, the follower (inner decision maker) will respond with _y_ = 0.0. This is better for the follower, but not for the leader.

Moreover, graphical analysis in Figure 16.1.1 in [(Shimizu et al., 1997)][Shimizu et al., 1997] shows discrepancy between geometry (polyhedron depicting constrain region) and the problem formulation. Therefore, in [sib_1997_02v](/BASBLib/LP-LP/sib_1997_02v) we present a variation of this problem. The only difference is the fourth inner constraint, which is changed from `-3x + 2y + 4 <= 0` into `3x - 2y - 4 <= 0`. After this modification, the optimal solution of [sib_1997_02v](/BASBLib/LP-LP/sib_1997_02v) occurs at (_x_*, _y_*) = (4.0, 4.0) with F* = -12.0 and f* = 4.0.

## Description of the problem in the `AMPL` format

```ruby
var x >= 0, <= 10;         # Outer variable
var y >= 0, <= 10;         # Inner variable
var l{1..6} >= 0, <= 10;   # KKT Multipliers

minimize outer_obj: x - 4*y;  # Outer objective

subject to
# Inner objective:
    inner_obj: y = 0;
# Inner constraints
    inner_con1: -x - y + 3 <= 0;
    inner_con2: -2*x + y <= 0;
    inner_con3: 2*x + y - 12 <= 0;
    inner_con4: -3*x + 2*y + 4 <= 0;
# KKT conditions:
    stationarity:      1 - l[1] + l[2] + l[3] + 2*l[4] - l[5] + l[6] = 0;
    complementarity_1: l[1]*(-x - y + 3) = 0;
    complementarity_2: l[2]*(-2*x + y) = 0;
    complementarity_3: l[3]*(2*x + y - 12) = 0;
    complementarity_4: l[4]*(-3*x + 2*y + 4) = 0;
    complementarity_5: l[5]*y = 0;
    complementarity_6: l[6]*(y - 10) = 0;
