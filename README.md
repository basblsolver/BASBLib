### A Test Set of Nonconvex Bilevel Problems 
> Used to test Branch-And-Sandwich BiLevel (BASBL) solver

In this repository we provide:
* Description of all problems `AMPL` format, compatible with the `BASBL` solver.

For more details on:
* The formulation of the problems and brief analysis of the feasible set and how the optimal solution can be obtained. 
* Helpful illustrations of the objective functions and geometry of the problems
see on [wiki](https://github.com/basblsolver/test-problems/wiki).
