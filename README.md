### A Test Set of Nonconvex Bilevel Problems 
> Used to test Branch-And-Sandwich BiLevel (BASBL) solver

In this repository we provide:
* The formulation of the problems and brief analysis of the feasible set and how the optimal solution can be obtained. 
* Helpful illustrations of the objective functions and geometry of the problems.  
* Description in `AMPL` format, used to describe bilevel instances for the `BASBL` solver.
