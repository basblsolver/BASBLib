# A Library of Nonconvex Bilevel Test Problems 

This repository provides:
* Description of all bilevel problems in `AMPL` format, compatible with the [`BASBL`](http://basblsolver.github.io/home/).

For more details on these problems see [wiki-page](https://github.com/basblsolver/test-problems/wiki).
